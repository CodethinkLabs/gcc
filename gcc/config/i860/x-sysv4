# We build all stages *without* shared libraries because that may make
# debugging the compiler easier (until there is a GDB which supports
# both Dwarf *and* svr4 shared libraries).

# Note that the native C compiler for the svr4 reference port on the
# i860 recognizes a special -gg option.  Using that option causes *full*
# Dwarf debugging information to be generated, whereas using only -g
# causes only limited Dwarf debugging information to be generated.
# (This is an undocumented feature of the native svr4 C compiler.)
