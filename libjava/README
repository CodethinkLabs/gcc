This is libgcj: the runtime library for gcj, the GNU Compiler for Java. 
libgcj provides a partial implementation of the Java Class Libraries.

libgcj is free software.  See the file LIBGCJ_LICENSE for copying permission.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

All documentation, including detailed installation and usage instructions,
can be found on the gcj web pages at this URL:

		http://sourceware.cygnus.com/java/


QUICK INSTALLATION
==================

  > mkdir build
  > cd build
  > ../libgcj/configure --enable-threads=<THREADS_TYPE>
  > make
  > make install

where:

<THREADS_TYPE> specifies the threads library to be used by libgcj. Currently 
the possible values are "posix" and "none". This value must be the same as
the value used when configuring gcc itself.

Consult the gcj web pages for additional "configure" arguments.

NOTE: libgcj can not be built in the same directory as `configure'. You must 
create a separate build directory.
